# Real-Time Emotion Recognition App

This application uses deep learning to perform real-time emotion recognition from webcam input. It can detect and classify seven different emotions: angry, fearful, happy, neutral, sad, and surprised.

## Features

- Real-time emotion detection using webcam
- Face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade
- Emotion classification using a trained deep learning model
- Live display of emotion probabilities
- User-friendly Streamlit interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Webcam
- Required Python packages (listed in requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-recognition-app.git
cd emotion-recognition-app
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run implement.py
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. Click the "Start" button to begin emotion recognition
4. Click the "Stop" button to stop the webcam feed

## Project Structure

- `implement.py`: Main application file
- `t4.h5`: Trained emotion recognition model
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Face detection cascade file
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies
- `packages.txt`: System dependencies

## Dependencies

### Python Packages
- streamlit==1.32.0
- opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78
- numpy==1.24.3
- tensorflow==2.15.0
- protobuf==3.20.3
- h5py==3.10.0
- pillow==9.5.0


## How It Works

1. The application captures video from your webcam
2. OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier detects faces in each frame
3. Detected faces are processed and fed into the emotion recognition model
4. The model predicts the emotion probabilities
5. Results are displayed in real-time with the highest probability emotion shown above the face
