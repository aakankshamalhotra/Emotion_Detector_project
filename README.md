Hey there! Welcome to my Emotion Detector project, where Iâ€™ve combined deep learning magic with some cool tech to recognize human emotions. 
This project uses Python, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), libraries (matplotlib etc, tensorflow, sklearn, keras etc), real-time face detection with OpenCV, and a sleek deployment on Streamlit to make emotion detection simple, interactive, and fun.

What Can This Do?
Detect emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more!
Works in real-time using your webcam. Lets you test on images and videos too.
Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.

Whatâ€™s Under the Hood?
Hereâ€™s what makes it all work:
CNNs: These neural networks are trained to recognize facial expressions and emotions.
OpenCV: Handles all the face detection and real-time image processing. 
Streamlit: Turns our project into a user-friendly web app.
Dataset: Trained using the Kaggle 2013 Emotion Dataset.

Preprocessing: Faces are detected and cropped. Images are resized and normalized for better training. 
Training: We used a CNN trained on the Kaggle dataset to learn to identify emotions. 
Real-Time Detection: Your webcam captures your face. OpenCV detects your face and passes it to the model. The model predicts your emotion and displays it live! 
Deployment: The whole project is wrapped into a Streamlit app for easy access. 

ðŸŽ¯ Results Accuracy: Achieved a solid accuracy of 69% around on the test dataset.
Performance: Works smoothly in real-time with minimal lag.
